# LociScan

## 1. Introduction
LociScan V2.0 is developed under the framework of .Net Framework 4.0, and the software can quickly and effectively screen out the best loci combinations by molecular markers such as SSR/STR, SNP and INDEL. The graphical user interface (GUI) version adopts traditional user interface design to facilitate quick master of the software by the users. The command line interface (CLI) version provides command line operation to facilitate handling of large scale training data. The software only supports reading and output of data in .CSV format. The core function is to screen out loci combinations with the highest VDP value out of a massive pool in a quick and simple way, so as to reduce the number of molecular marker loci, cut the cost of molecular tests and improve the efficiency of plant variety discrimination.
For details about how to operate the software, see the user manual
